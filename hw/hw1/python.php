                Python is an open source programming language, it<br>
                was made to both look good and be easy to read. <br>
                It was created by a programmer named Guido van Rossum. <br><br>
                Python has a very easy to read syntax. Some of it comes from C,<br>
                because that is the language that Python was written in. One big change <br>
                with Python is the use of whitespace to delimit code: spaces or tabs <br>
                are used to organize code by the amount of spaces or tabs.<strong>This means at <br>
                the end of each line, a semicolon is not needed and curly braces ({})</strong>  <br>
                are not used to group code, which are both common in C. The combined effect makes<br>
                Python a very easy to read language<br>

               Python came out as a result of boredom of its author Van Rossum <br>
               during the Christmas week of 1989. Also, as one of the answers mentioned, <br>
               its name has nothing to do with a type of snake but with a sketch <br>
               comedy group “Monty Python”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python influenced JavaScript. For non-programmers, JavaScript is the language<br>
                which is present on 99.99% of the websites and enables all the cool features of <br>
                the websites(coupled with jQuery, which was futher written in JavaScript).
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is one of the only languages I've known in which there exists an "Else"<br>
                clause for For loops. It's a special type of syntax that executes only <br>
                if the for loop exits naturally, without any break statements.
