                C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both <br>
                high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C with classes"<br>
                as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes."<br>
                However, it was renamed C++ in 1983. It is pronounced "see-plus-plus."

            <p>
               According to Wikipedia, C++ has influenced many other<br>
               programming languages, some of which include C#, Java and <br>
               even newer versions of C                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although it was lacking in C, object-oriented programming was introduced <br>
                in C++. Among other things, C++ supports the four primary <br>
                features of OOP: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation. 
            </p>
          
            <p>
                C++ has two primary concepts on which the language was<br>
                built: direct mapping for hardware features and zero-overhead<br>
                abstractions for mapping. Perhaps this is why the language<br>
                is often touted as a lightweight abstraction programming language <br>
                used for creating efficient abstractions while also offering hardware <br>
                access.
