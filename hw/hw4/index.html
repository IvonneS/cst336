<!--
Idea: Create a multiple choice quiz generator
Requirements: *There are at least four different types of Form Elements.
              *Upon submission of the form, the data is "processed" and new data is displayed.
              *Validation for all unset or empty values with error messages. 
              *Upon submission of the form, the form is displayed again,
              with the submitted values pre-filled.
Date: 11/13/2018
Recreate the assigment using JavaScript and jQuery

Program uses some of the elements used in Assignments 2 or 3 (conditions, loops, arrays, form elements) (40 pts)
Program processes data and not just displays again the values entered (20 pts)
Program uses both JavaScript and jQuery (15 pts)
Program uses Bootstrap (or has a nice look and feel) (15 pts)
You post a clickable link to the assignment (10 pts)
